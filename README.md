# ec_curve
An elementary example of calculating private and plublic keys for Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). Part of a network security class.

A very simple example to show some concepts of elliptic cryptography. It demonstrates:
* Calculating private and public keys using an elliptic curve
* A simple example of point doubling
* How to find multiplicative inverses
* Plotting a curve
