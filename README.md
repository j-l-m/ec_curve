# ec_curve
A "toy" example of an calculating private and plublic keys for EC crptyography. Part of a network security class.

A very simple example to show some concepts of EC cryptography. It demonstrates:
* Calculating private and public keys using an EC curve
* A simple example of point doubling
* How to find multiplicative inverses
* Plotting a curve
